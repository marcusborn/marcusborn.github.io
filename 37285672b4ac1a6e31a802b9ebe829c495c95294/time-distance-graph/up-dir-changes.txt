This is a text file to track changes made to the get_gradients function 

1. for up direction gradients need to be reversed. gradients and gradient chainages are put into reversed gradients function. 

2. The logic needs to change for many conditional statements. 

3. distances are now negative. This means that they have to change average gradient function, hence a change in d1 & d2 variables. 

Other changes!
Equality sign change !
                    `if (reversed_gradient_chainages[j] <= current_signal_chainage){
                        temp_array_to_find_gradient.push(reversed_gradients[j])
                    }` 

 Max changed to min!
                     `if (temp_grads_array.length == 0){
                        temp_grads_array.push(Math.min(...temp_array_to_find_gradient));
                    }` 


Notes:
i should make gradients into a function that takes in params (up/down) & (olap/signal/space)

-Gradients in up direction also need to have a negative sign in front as they are going in the opposite directions.




4. Flagging this to check more!
                for (let k=0; k< temp_grad_chainages.length-1; k++){
                    // console.log(k);
                    let temp_distance = temp_grad_chainages[k+1]-temp_grad_chainages[k];

                    to 
                for (let k=0; k< temp_grad_chainages.length-1; k++){
                    // console.log(k);
                    let temp_distance = temp_grad_chainages[k] - temp_grad_chainages[k+1];



UP AND DOWN GRADIENTS ARE DIFFERENT!!!
They are reversed, multiplied by -1 and also SHIFTED a place!


Massive bug found!!! this bug has not been fixed in down direction (16/12/2022)
this returns min grad instead of min chainage!
                if (temp_grads_array.length == 0){
                    temp_grads_array.push(Math.min(...temp_array_to_find_gradient));
                    console.log(`no intermediate gradients! but signal ${current_signal_name} has grads : ${temp_grads_array}`)
                }




1.Overlaps calcs are disregarding gradients

2. up-overlaps are calculating distance wrong!

Olaps should be resolved

not sure about the signal spacing between
