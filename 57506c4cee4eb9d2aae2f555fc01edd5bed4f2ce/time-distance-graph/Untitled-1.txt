CALCULATING HEADWAY:

The ebst way to calculate headway:

Get the current signal,
Get the final O/lap after the aspect sequence. (e.g G, Y/R, R/R. Olap)
Add Train Length Distance
Add 12s from the start (note: may not need this if the signal is sighted at a platform)(if this sighting is an acceleration or at linespeed)
